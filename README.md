**ALE SENSIBLE is a 190-byte-long new default overriding ALE's defaults. It's welcoming, stutter-free, turn-key-ready.**

## Features
**Experience a butter-smooth intuitive UI** out of the box, PlugInstall and code. Fix all of ALE's annoyances with one line _without_ reading bulky docs, a +40Kb README ğŸ˜¬ or verbose help files. The README you're reading is 3Kb and you won't need more. Don't waste time with a linter's setup. _It's. just. a. linter._ Move on, keep on coding, create stuff. A linter should fix _your_ code, it's not the way around.

- **No more stuttery gutter** shaking up your code, pumping in and out
- **Easy quick-switching of buffers and files** without a laggy ALE bumping the gutter in your face
- **No nervously blinking ALE** warning and messing in the current line while you code
- **ALE SENSIBLE kicks in when it's the right time:** in Normal _always_ and in Insert _only_ after leaving Insert Mode
- **No intentionally delayed linting**, responsive linting always after 0ms (ALE sets an extra 200ms delay)
- **No more broken colorthemes**, no dull grey gutter anymore, ALE SENSIBLE works w/all colorthemes
- **No bloat in .vimrc/init.vim**, no fiddling around, no trial and error, it's just one line pulling a 190-byte-plugin
- **No mess with other gutter tools** which are more important (e.g. git tools, markers)
- **Easily remove and add ALE SENSIBLE**, sometimes you want it uninstalled and `:ALEToogle' wouldn't help 
- **Experience Vim/Neovim as what they are**, slick, minmalistic editors, not some jarring Frankenstein-IDEs

**Linters are overrated:** Actually most of us are less productive with linters than without because of 'configuration porn', finding right defaults, getting the liner fast, fixing wrong linter warnings and testing different linting engines for days. Only because ALE is asynchornous doesn't make it less distracting. Think back: When was the last time your created some masterpiece of code? You remember? **Did you use a linter then?** ğŸ˜¶

## Install

**No more half-baken ALE,** no more time-wasting, vim-plug users just put...
```
Plug 'desmap/ale-sensible' | Plug 'w0rp/ale'
```
...in their .vimrc/init.vim and don't need to touch again ALE. If you have already a line with `Plug 'w0rp/ale`, remove it. Adapt above for other plugin managers or just copy'n'paste from [ale-sensible.vim](https://github.com/desmap/ale-sensible/blob/master/plugin/ale-sensible.vim).

If you want fixers, install all linters/fixers you want (don't mix local and global installs!) and ALE will find them. To set fixers, e.g. first Prettier, second Standard JS, add `let g:ale_fixers = ['prettier', 'standard']` to your .vimrc/init.vim. To execute them, run `:ALEFix`. This should be enough for a quick start. Further ALE options/commands => `:help ale` but remember, you should rather be coding than reading a linter's help file. ğŸ˜‰
